# Learning Typesetting Systems
This repository contains necessary information gained while learning the industry standard and modern typesetting softwares (LaTeX and typst).
The repository is to contain two folders, one for LaTeX-related content and the other for typst related content.

## Resources used:
- typst: [The official documentation](https://typst.app/docs/)
- LaTeX: (Unknown for now)

### Compilation
To compile any typst file, using the [typst-cli](https://github.com/typst/typst), run the following command in terminal:
```
# Creates `<filename.pdf>` in the working directory
typst compile <filename.typ>
```
